# the backstory

The client company had *millions* of consumers who simultaneously use **many methods of storing data**, including phones, USB drives, computers, external hard drives, and cloud services.
​
But what's the experience like for these users?

# qualitative interviews - the problem of duplicates

From generative qualitative interviews, it became clear that **staying organized** with 3+ storage devices often make our users anxious and overwhelmed because they face a "mountain of files" that are all over the place.
 
Users end up with **lots of duplicates** transferring files between sources or when buying a new computer - thus compounding the problem of mountains of files.
​
There was also a general mistrust towards software automatically organizing users' files.

# Job to be done 1

When I need space on my device, I want to be able to start cleaning without without feeling paralyzed and stressed about where to even begin.

# Job to be done 2

When I am looking for a file, I want to be able to quickly find it without having to search through folders of partially duplicated content.

> How might we help users **prevent and clean duplicates** in a manner that is not stressful over time?

# competitors, features, and complexity

All of the competitors examined emphasize searching for duplicates across only one device, which means a **market opportunity** for us.

Many of these tend to be pretty utilitarian, and provided **hundreds of complex ways** to find duplicates - not exactly helping the "overwhelming" feeling of cleaning!

Most operate by first asking the user to choose what folders they wanted to include in the search.
