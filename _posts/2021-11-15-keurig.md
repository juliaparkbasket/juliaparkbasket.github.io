# the backstory

"I wish my Keurig wasn't such an enabler. It's too easy to drink too much caffeine."

This was a comment from a coffee-loving friend who was frustrated that her Keurig always provided quick and easy coffee and never told her no. Which got me thinking...

What if working machines had a sense of judgement? What if they could gauge whether performing the requested task is or isn't in the user’s best interests, based on what the user says or the user’s behavior?

The average American consumes over 3 cups of coffee a day - and over consumption can lead to anxiety, tremors, restlessness, and so much more. This project explores how a Keurig might regulate caffeine intake by reacting to emotional and health cues from the user.
